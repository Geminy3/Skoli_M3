RECLAIMING PERSONAL DATA
Thanks to "MesInfos", two hundred citizen‐testers were able to choose whether to make their data available or not and see how this data could be applied, with the effective support of Tubà. 
After more than two years of development, the goal is to make known the social and economic benefits of this experiment and to strengthen the positioning of Lyon Métropole as an area of innovation at the service of local residents.
